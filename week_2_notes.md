# Mathematical Thinking Notes - Week 2

What is our strategy for solving problems at this point of the course?

1. Understand deeply - don't face complex issues head on, first understand the basics more deeply.  If the issue starts from a very complex place, can you simplify it before you begin solving?

2. Make mistakes - start looking for a solution in a logical way.  If you don't start you can never finish.  You will inevitably make mistakes - but if you have approached the problem systematically this should help you get to the answer.  At each point, ask yourself what all the options available to you are - if there are only a few you might be able to explore all of them.

3. Raise questions - Constantly try to clarify your understanding.  What is the state of the problem?  Are you answering the right question.

4. Follow the flow of ideas.  Keep track of where you have come from and where you can go now.  If you make a mistake this will make it easier for you to analyse and go back to an appropriate place.

5. Change - if you don't change your approach how can you expect a different result?

## Making a good representation

It is important that your representation of the problem contains the information you need to know the current state of the problem (at least, the important parts of it).  The towers of hanoi is a good example of this - there is not much point recording the moves.  If you only have moves recorded, it is hard to calculate the current state of the board.  Instead, if you record the state of the board from move to move, you can easily calculate the move between each state.
