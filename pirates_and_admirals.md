# Pirates and Admirals - Puzzle Notes

## The problem

3 admirals and 3 pirates are walking across a terrain and come to a river.  They need to cross a river.  There is no bridge in sight.  There is a boat, but only 2 people can get in at a time.  If the pirates ever outnumber the admirals it will be dicey.  How can you go about getting all of the pirates and admirals across the river.

## The solution

Start by taking one pirate and one admiral - leave the admiral on the other side and make the admiral come back.

You have 1 pirate on the left bank and 3 admirals and 2 pirates on the right bank.

The make 2 pirates go back.  You then have 3 pirates on one side and 3 admirals on the other.

Make one pirate return, leave him on the right bank and make 2 admirals get in the boat.

You now have 2 admirals on the left bank, 2 pirates on the left bank, 1 admiral on the right bank and 1 pirate on the right bank.

Make a pirate and an admiral return.  You have 1 pirate and 1 admiral on the left bank.  You have 2 pirates and 2 admirals on the right bank.

Make 2 admirals go to the left bank.  You then have 3 admirals on the left bank and 1 pirate.  You have 2 pirates on the right bank.

Make the pirate return by himself and pick up another pirate.  Drop him off.  Then go back and pick up the last pirate.  Both pirates go to the left bank and you are done!
