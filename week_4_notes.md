# Week 4 Lecture Notes

## Dodgeball

Player one has a 6x6 grid.  

Player two has one row of that grid.

Player one completes his first row with X's or O's distributed however he wants.

Player two then completes the first square of their row with either an X or an O, whichever they want.

The players then repeat.

The aim is that player 2 dodges every one of the rows that player 1 writes.

You'll notice that with this game player 2 should always win - they get to go last on each turn.  By making sure they do the opposite of player 1, they ensure that there are at least 2 options available for them when player 1 makes their next turn to avoid getting "hit".
