# Week 3 Notes

## Infinity minus 1

If you have a collection of an infinite number of golf balls and a collection of an infinite number of ping pong balls, do you have the same number of golf balls and ping pong balls?  The instinctive answer is yes.

Now we throw away one ping pong ball - do we still have the same number of gold balls and ping pong balls?  Why?

This is a hard question because infinity is an unfamiliar and generally unnatural concept to us.  Don't be afraid to make mistakes, to struggle with vagueness, go down dead ends in thought experiments etc.

How do we know that two sets are equal?  We could do what a child would do - one for me, one for you.  If we run out of items in both sets at the same time or never run out of items, we can say that both sets are equal.  

If we approach the problem in this way, we can say that both sets will still be equal.  Using mathematical terminology, we would say that both sets have the same cardinality.

## The Infinity Inn

In this scenario, you have an Inn with infinite rooms and a team with infinite players.  The team is staying at the Inn with one player occupying one room.  The Inn is therefore full.

The manager of the team comes along and asks for a room.  The Inn is full, but can you make room for the manager without making any of the players share a room?

Think about what we did last time.  Lets take all of the players out of their rooms.  Now the players and their manager is one set.  And the rooms is another set.  Could we pair the two sets on a one to one basis?  Yes.

What if another team of infinite players arrived at the Inn.  Could we provide both teams with a room for each player?  Yes, Room 1 goes to Team A player 1, Room 2 goes to Team B player 1, Room 3 goes to Team A Player 2 and so on...  We have just shown the cardinality of one infinite set (the rooms) to two infinite sets (the players).
